The tests that start with "ruben" where taken from an AI course imparted by Ruben Stranders.

The breast_cancer test was taken from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data

Modifications where made in the breast_cancer dataset to make it linearly separable.
Some tests in this file were repeated in order to have 60,000 evaluations and make it
clearer on the benefits of fork-join. The tests that where copied are not used in the
training part.


The tests may be ran in two ways, showing or not the results.
To show them add the flag -true at the end, example:
java MainForkJoinPerceptron < ./tests/ruben_or.txt -true

It's not recommended to add the flag in the breast_cancer.txt since it will print
approximately 120,000 lines to the console

Expected results:

For ruben_linearly_separable.txt:
0
1
0
1
1
0

For ruben_no_solution.txt and ruben_no_solution_2.txt:
There's no solution

For ruben_or.txt:
0
1
0

About the speed up, the "ruben" tests won't show a speed up since the number of
tests calculated are too small to show an improvement using fork-join, it may
even be slower using this framework. However you'll be able to appreciate the
speed up in larger datasets, as the breast_cancer.txt.

To add your own dataset please take in account the following considerations:
* The dataset must be all numeric
* The output must be binary (0 or 1)
* The first number indicates the number of attributes
* The second number indicates the number of records used to train
* The third number indicates the number of tests to run
* The following lines should be the training records and the tests to run
